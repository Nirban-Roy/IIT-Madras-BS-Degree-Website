    <section id="about-iitm" class="content-section">
      <h2 class="section-heading">About IIT Madras</h2>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Indian Institute of Technology Madras is one of the foremost institutes of 
        national importance for higher technical education and research.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        In 1956, the German Government offered technical assistance in establishing 
        an institute of higher education in engineering in India. 
        The first Indo-German Agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment 
        of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, 
        Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. 
        The IIT system has twenty three Institutes of Technology. 
        The first of these to be instituted are at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai (estb. 1958), 
        Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi (estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) 
        and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined IITs in 2001).
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced research centres 
        in various disciplines of engineering and pure sciences. A faculty of international repute, 
        a brilliant student community, excellent technical &amp; supporting staff, 
        and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of IIT Madras. 
        The campus is located in the city of Chennai, previously known as Madras. 
        Chennai is the state capital of Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India.

    <!-- IITM's Experience in Online Education -->
    <section id="iitm-experience" class="content-section">
      <h2 class="section-heading">IITM's Experience in Online Education</h2>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        IITM is well-equipped to provide an online degree course. 
        We have been ranked number 1 engineering institute for the past 5 years 
        and we have been ranked number 1 Overall for the past 2 years by NIRF.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Furthermore, IITM began the NPTEL program, the country’s first online content portal 
        as an inter-IIT consortium project in 2001 and <em>nptel.ac.in</em> is one of the largest 
        online course portals in the world. In 2014, IITM also created NPTEL online courses – 
        the country’s first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). Today, NPTEL is considered 
        the largest MOOC provider in India.
      </p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        MHRD launched the SWAYAM MOOC platform in 2017 and NPTEL has been the largest contributor to it. 
        NPTEL also manages the national MOOCs portal - <em>swayam.gov.in</em> 
        as well as the network of more than 3800 SWAYAM local chapter colleges. 
        With IITM continuing to lead the NPTEL project, it makes them the perfect choice 
        to offer an online degree program.

    <!-- Why an Online Degree Initiative -->
    <section id="why-online-degree" class="content-section">
      <h2 class="section-heading">Why an Online Degree Initiative?</h2>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        IIT Madras wishes to reach out to the many aspiring and motivated learners across India. 
        An online degree is the perfect way to accomplish this, as it is not limited by on-campus 
        physical infrastructure. 
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Being an online program, we can accommodate between 50,000 to a lakh learners per batch.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is a game changer as <strong>working professionals</strong> and learners of 
          <strong>any age group</strong> can enroll in it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students currently enrolled in a physical college in any program can join here 
          and <strong>earn their second degree</strong>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There are <strong>no restrictions on the base subjects</strong>. 
          Students from other streams such as commerce / arts / law can enroll.
        </li>
        <li>
          All courses will be offered 3 times a year. 
          Learners have <strong>considerable flexibility</strong> in the pace they select 
          to move ahead in the program.
        </li>
        <li>
          The program gives flexibility to learners to set their goals. 
          Learners who successfully complete all 8 courses in Foundation Level can exit 
          with a certificate if they wish. Alternatively, they can proceed to the 
          BSc Degree or BS Degree, or exit with Diplomas in Programming and/or Data Science. 
          (Check the <em>Academics</em> page for details.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The program will be rigorous in its delivery, just as any other program from IIT Madras. 
          Learners have to spend time with the coursework every week and achieve minimum criteria 
          to pass every course.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being an online program, <strong>the course content can be accessed by learners from anywhere</strong>. 
          They need a laptop/desktop, a good internet connection, and more importantly, the will to learn 
          and work hard. Learners will be required to travel to designated exam centres only for 
          the quizzes and exam sessions. (View section about <em>exam cities</em> for details.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Each course will have a <strong>discussion forum with an active academic team</strong> 
          to help in clearing doubts. Personalised mentors will help students with Diploma Level 
          and Degree Level courses.
        </li>
        <li>
          In future, we are considering <strong>tie-ups with industries</strong> to enable 
          internships and project opportunities. This will also facilitate hiring of our learners 
          who perform well in the program.
